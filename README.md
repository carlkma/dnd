# Block-based Programming Puzzle

## About
This is a drag-and-drop programming interface based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd). 

Features:
* Each block, or puzzle piece, can be connected to other blocks, forming a correct syntax for the Python programming language 
* Certain blocks allow direct user inputs
* A JSON file detailing the order, line number, and indentation of blocks can be generated on click
* Indentations, as per Python PEP 8 standards, are achieved through a special indentation block: visible to users, but omitted in data structures and JSON outputs

## Installation

*All systems*
1. Download and install all dependencies, including but not limited to `Node.JS`, `React`, and `react-beautiful-dnd`
1. `cd ` to `dnd/`
1. Initiate the development server by `npm start`

**NOTE:** This distribution does NOT contain third-party modules, packages, and dependencies due to file size and copyright concerns. Hence, the scripts in `dnd/src/` does **NOT** work without manual installation of external libraries.

The User Interface:

Users are able to drag and drop blocks left and right horizontally

Users are able to drag and drop blocks from one line to another vertically

Users are able to directly input code

By clicking the Export JSON button, a JSON file is automatically downloaded

The exported JSON file is consistent with what is expected

## Brief History
This project was initiated in February 2022 as part of the authorâ€™s interest in designing block-based programming environments for novice programmers.

This project is in its early stages of development, and is expected to undergo significant changes and enhancements.
